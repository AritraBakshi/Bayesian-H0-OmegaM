# Bayesian H₀ & Ωₘ Inference  
**Bayesian inference for cosmological parameters using PyMC and Astropy**  

## 🚀 Overview  
This repository applies **Bayesian inference** to estimate cosmological parameters such as the **Hubble constant (H₀)** and the **matter density parameter (Ωₘ)** using **PyMC, Astropy, and interpolation techniques**.  

## 🔥 Key Features
✅ **Bayesian Modeling** with PyMC for H₀ and Ωₘ inference  
✅ **Astropy Cosmology** for comparison with standard models  
✅ **Efficient Interpolation** to speed up integral calculations  
✅ **Taylor Series Approximation** for luminosity distance  
✅ **Corner Plots & Contour Analysis** to visualize parameter correlations  

## The script will:  
1️⃣ Generate synthetic luminosity distance data  
2️⃣ Perform Bayesian inference using PyMC  
3️⃣ Compare results using corner plots & Taylor series approximation  
 
## 📊 Results:  
📌 Corner Plot of z, z², z³, ..., z⁶, D_L (Integral & Taylor) 

📌 Best-fit Luminosity Distance 

The posterior distributions of H₀ and Ωₘ are inferred and visualized using corner plots.
The comparison between integral-based and Taylor series luminosity distances highlights truncation effects.

## 🚀 To-Do: 
🔹 Incorporate real observational data 

🔹 Extend Taylor series to higher orders 

🔹 Optimize interpolation performance
